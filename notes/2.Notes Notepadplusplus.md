#### 1) Sorting lines in numeric order in Notepad++?

This is now easy to achieve (at least in Notepad++ 7.5.9):

Use the menu item: `Edit` -> `Line Operations` -> `Sort Lines As Integers Ascending`

(Note if you don't select any text it will sort the entire file, and if you select text it constrains the sorting to the selected text.)
